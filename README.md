Rails 3, RSpec, Factory Girl, Haml, and jQuery
----------------------------------------------

Easily generate a Rails 3 application with RSpec, Factory Girl, Haml, and
jQuery in one line:

    %rails my_app -J -T -m
    http://github.com/leshill/rails3_app/raw/master/app.rb

This also gives you the Factory Girl and Haml Rails 3 generators &mdash; the
generators for RSpec are in the RSpec gem &mdash; so that your factories and
views are generated using Factory Girl and Haml. These generators are from the
**rails3_generators** gem, we pulled them out to avoid all the other
dependencies included in the gem.

Since the Rails helper `javascript_include_tag :defaults` is looking for
Prototype, we have added a new JavaScript expansion to pull in jQuery and
jQuery UI. Use it like so:

    = javascript_include_tag :jquery

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.  (if you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
